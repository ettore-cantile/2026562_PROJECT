# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

AresGuard is a distributed, event-driven automation platform designed to monitor and manage a fragile Mars habitat. The system ingests data from heterogeneous REST sensors (polling), normalizes the telemetry into a Unified Event Schema, evaluates automated safety rules through a dedicated engine, and provides a real-time dashboard. 

The dashboard serves three main personas: 
* The **Mission Specialist** (for real-time monitoring and manual overrides).
* The **Automation Engineer** (to configure safety rules).
* The **Safety Officer** (to audit system health and automatic interventions).

# USER STORIES

1. **As a Mission Specialist**, I want to view the continuously updated temperature of the greenhouse so that I can monitor crop health without manually refreshing the dashboard.
2. **As a Mission Specialist**, I want to check the current water tank level on the dashboard so that I know how much water is left for hydroponic irrigation.
3. **As a Mission Specialist**, I want a dedicated button to manually turn on the hall ventilation so that I can rapidly cycle the air if I detect smoke or stale air.
4. **As a Mission Specialist**, I want the dashboard to visually highlight critical CO2 levels in red and trigger a system-wide warning when the concentration exceeds 1000 ppm, so that I can immediately take safety measures or evacuate the hall.
5. **As an Automation Engineer**, I want the system to continuously gather data from all available sensors so that the automation logic always evaluates the most recent habitat conditions.
6. **As an Automation Engineer**, I want to automatically convert all incoming sensor data into a single, unified format so that the core system logic is decoupled from specific device dialects.
7. **As an Automation Engineer**, I want to define an automatic rule that turns on the hall ventilation if the CO2 level exceeds a safe threshold so that dangerous carbon dioxide buildup is prevented.
8. **As an Automation Engineer**, I want all created automation rules to be securely saved so that I don't have to reconfigure the habitat's safety protocols if the system restarts.
9. **As a Safety Officer**, I want the dashboard to visually alert the crew if the corridor pressure drops below a safe threshold so that everyone is warned of a potential hull breach.
10. **As a Safety Officer**, I want to consult a historical log showing when and why an actuator was automatically triggered so that I can audit the system's "autopilot" behavior after an incident.

# CONTAINERS

## CONTAINER_NAME: Frontend

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
Connects directly to the **API Gateway** (via HTTP and WebSockets) and the **Simulator** (for manual forced fetches). Uses *Chart.js* via CDN for data visualization.

### MICROSERVICES

#### MICROSERVICE: aresguard_frontend
* **TYPE:** frontend
* **DESCRIPTION:** Serves the Single Page Application (SPA) dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS, hosted on an Nginx alpine server.
* **PORTS:** `80` (Internal) / `3000` (External)
* **TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION:**

## CONTAINER_NAME: API_Gateway

### DESCRIPTION 
Acts as the central communication hub. It exposes REST endpoints for rule management, proxies commands to the simulator, maintains the in-memory state of the latest sensor readings, and broadcasts updates to connected clients via WebSockets.

### PORTS 
`8000:8000`

### PERSISTENCE EVALUATION
Maintains an in-memory cache (`sensor_state_cache`) for the latest telemetry data to provide instant full-state sync upon client connection. Connects to PostgreSQL to read, write, update, and delete automation rules.

### EXTERNAL SERVICES CONNECTIONS
Connects to **RabbitMQ** to consume the normalized telemetry stream. Connects to **PostgreSQL**. Connects to the **Simulator** to proxy actuator POST commands.

### MICROSERVICES

#### MICROSERVICE: aresguard_api_gateway
* **TYPE:** backend / middleware
* **DESCRIPTION:** Central API and WebSocket manager.
* **PORTS:** `8000`

  * Python 3.9
  * FastAPI (Web framework)
  * Uvicorn (ASGI server)
  * aio-pika (Asynchronous RabbitMQ client)
  * psycopg2-binary (PostgreSQL adapter)
* **SERVICE ARCHITECTURE:**
  Asynchronous event loop consuming from RabbitMQ while simultaneously serving REST requests and broadcasting over WebSockets.
* **ENDPOINTS:**

  | HTTP METHOD | URL | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **GET** | `/api/state` | Returns the full in-memory cache of sensors |
  | **POST** | `/api/commands/{actuator_id}` | Proxies manual commands to the Simulator |
  | **GET** | `/api/rules` | Retrieves all saved automation rules |
